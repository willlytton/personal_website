              Hi, my name is William and I am fullstack software engineer with a
              love for the arts and all things related to the human experience. I believe by bridging arts and
              technology with a little bit of love we can solve most of the worlds
              problems. I am based out of Brooklyn, NY, but I'm rooted from the
              southern state of Georgia. If you like what you see and would like
              to reach out please feel free to contact me using the links above
