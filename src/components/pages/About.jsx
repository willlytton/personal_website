            Hi, my name is William and I am fullstack software engineer with a
            love for the arts and figuring out innovatives ways to spark the
            mind to think outside of the box. So I guess you could call me an
            exceptional critical thinker. I believe by bridging arts and
            technology with a little bit of love we can solve most of the worlds
            problems. I am based out of Brooklyn, NY, but I'm rooted from the
            southern state of Georgia. If you like what you see and would like
            to reach out please feel free to contact me using the links above
